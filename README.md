The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from sepals' and petals' length and width measurements. 
The central goal is to design a model that makes proper classifications for new flowers. In other words, one which exhibits good generalization.


Description :
- This is a classification project. Indeed, the variable to be predicted is categorical (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).
- The goal is to model class membership probabilities conditioned on the flower features.
